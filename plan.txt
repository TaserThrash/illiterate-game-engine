the overall purpose of my game engine is to
allow illiterates to make games.
so far there is a screen where the user can 
see the objects as they will start the game 
move the starting positions and enlarge objects
and also a play button to bring you to another
screen there is another screen where the user
can draw an object and a button to return the
user to the first screen and yet another which
allows you to go to yet another screen where
the user can change the properties of the
selected object so far I only have gravity
and the bounciness mass
I also plan to add friction and likely 
others there is also in this screen a button
to return to the first screen while we are
at the first screen let's hit the play
button now the user is running the game
and can see the objects fall and bounce since that's
all they can do so far I plan to eventually
add a screen where the user can connect inputs
to actions by drawing a line from the D on the
left and the move right icon on the right I also 
might add a screen where similar things can be done 
to create an AI with inputs on the left actions on 
the right and options to add logic gates in the 
middle. I plan to and have so far succeeded to 
use only visual icons like pencils and gears 
along with animations to help the player understand 
stuff like the properties increase gravity the 
rectangle falls faster increase bounciness it 
bounces higher
