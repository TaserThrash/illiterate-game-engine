Game Engine Designed for Young Creators

I'm developing a game engine that empowers even those who haven't learned to read yet to create their own games! It's designed specifically with young children in mind, using visuals and animations to make game development fun and accessible for everyone.

Key Features:

Visual Interface: No text required! Icons, symbols, and animations guide users through the entire process.
Drawing Your Own Characters: Kids can unleash their creativity by drawing their own unique game objects.
Customizable Properties: Objects can be made bouncier, heavier, or even gravity-defying!
Interactive Playground: Easily move objects around and adjust their starting positions to create the perfect game setup.
Brain Screen (Work in Progress): This exciting feature will allow users to connect inputs (like keyboard keys or on-screen buttons) to actions, bringing their games to life with movement and interactivity.
Recent Progress:

Foundation Built: The core screens for drawing objects, setting properties, and playing the game are functional.
Brain Screen Development: Keyboard inputs and movement actions are now working, and further development is underway for on-screen buttons and inputs taken from the environment.
